            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> 
                Following finishing a bachelor's degree in biology at Shiraz University, Iran, in 2011, 
                in the entrance exam for the master's degree, I got the 6th rank out of about 18,000 
                participants and started my studies in biochemistry at the University of Tehran, 
                the first-ranked university in Iran and one of the top 10 universities in the 
                Middle East. 
                In 2014, I managed to rank 8th out of 1500 participants in the Ph.D. entrance exam 
                in neuroscience at the Iran University of Medical Sciences, one of the top universities 
                in Iran. 
                Since I earned my Ph.D. in 2019, I began working as a lecturer and researcher in 
                the neurocognitive center at Iran psychiatric hospital. My interest in web 
                development and programming has also led me to learn Python (PsychoPy, Django), 
                MATLAB (COGENT), HTML, and CSS through self-learning. 
                Recently, in collaboration with the Department of behavioral and 
                movement science, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and as a visiting scholar, I am 
                examining the effect of the frequency and complexity of visual stimuli on the 
                perception of time. I am motivated and energetic, interested in learning, 
                usually collaborate well with others in teamworks, and always try to do my best to 
                fulfill my responsibilities. I always welcome new situations, even if they are 
                challenging, because they provide me with the opportunity to learn and gain new 
                experiences. 
            </p>
